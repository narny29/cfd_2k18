# The Problem Statement
  Natural Disasters are a major cause of loss of lives. People may be trapped for days or weeks and even lose their lives because rescue teams cannot trace them. Most of the times, they are trapped completely and cannot call for help. This has been a problem since the beginning. In recent years, the death toll due to earthquake is more than all other natural disasters combined. Here's a stat from International Disaster Database-

# Our Solution Approach
  We approach the problem by Integrating Automated as well as Custom Triggering of Emergency SOS and sending relevant data conservatively and smartly from the victim's phone to Rescue Teams. Triggering the app can be automated to all nearby phones once a disaster has been confirmed in and around an particular area. IOT devices may be integrated to enhance the functionality of the app. For example, we could use information from a stable earthquake detector nearby or a CCTV footage to determine if a particular area is affected. If yes, then the App will be activated in all the devices in the area.

  Relevant data may include current GPS coordinates of the phone, a front and rear camera picture to help gather more information as well as any audio data that might be relevant for providing more information for the rescue process to be a success. For example, if the user is trapped completely during an earthquake and cannot move his hands, the user may still be able to talk to the phone (the app will record audio data by notifying the user in regular intervals) and provide some extra information. 
  
  Our target is to provide enough information for successful rescue of all victims in the area keeping in mind, power and battery constraints of the phone.
  
  With the expanding reach of the internet and technology, it is quite common for people to carry their phones everywhere with them. Given that at the time the disaster strikes the victim had his phone with him, it will be easier for rescue teams to locate the him sooner instead of naively searching an area.
